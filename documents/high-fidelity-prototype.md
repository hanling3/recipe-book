    - Budget-friendly. Take advantage of filters and enable users to plan meals according to an inputted budget amount. 
    - Time-conscious. Rethink meal planning and allow users to customize their meals of the day by filtering recipes based on expected time.

## 1. Revisions to Prior Work
### Address revisions to persona (Ada)
### Address revisions from TA - final sketches (Xinlu)
We add some arrows and annotation between each pages to help audience better understand app's pages navigation of final sketch.


## 2. Planning & Psuedocode
### (1) Usability Test
Except for the final sketch we made in the milestone 3, we decided to make a prototype using Figma and conducted usability tests. We volunteered to do the usability tests because we felt it was very necessary to get feedback and revise our design in the early stage. We believed it would actually save us time since we could fix the design problems before we started coding. We chose to use Figma instead of the final sketch for the usability test because the Figma prototype would be much more similar to the final product, and therefore, the feedback received from using Figama should be more accurate than the ones received from using paper prototype.

The Figma prototype link can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/Vzdd7cwBkYE4uABQlfRsJs/App-prototype?node-id=0%3A1

The usability test protocol, raw notes, and summary can be found in the "Additional Items" section.

### (2ï¼‰App Structure
![information hierarchy](documents/images/information_hierarchy/0_overview.png)

We drew this information hierarchy to help us plan the app structure. Our app has four main pages: browse, plan, saved, and profile. By analyzing the elements on each page, we compartmentalized the app into the layout part and component part. The layout part is to arrange the UI elements location on every single page, so the app will look like the prototype. Components are the UI elements that shared across pages or used multiple times, such as the recipe card, recipe detail page, and the bottom navigation bar. The component part is implemented, so the information will be exchanged across different app pages, and the app will be functional.

### (3) Schedule

We discussed and agreed on this in-team schedule to help us track the progress. We tried to stick to this schedule as close as possible. Most of the work has been finished in time. 


## 3. Coding
