# Milestone 4: High-Fidelity Prototype

## 0. Overview
For this milestone, we constructed an information hierarchy, created an app construction schedule, and then constructed our app based on our schedule. 

## 1. Revisions to Prior Work
For this milestone, we revised some items in Milestone 2. In particular, we revised our persona, so that there was a better alignment of our persona's goals and the final creation of our app, and it was clear how our app features connected to our persona's needs.

Additionally, we revised our final sketches, by adding arrows so that the information flow between the UI frames was clearer.
