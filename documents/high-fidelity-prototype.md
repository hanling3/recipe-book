## 1. Revisions to Prior Work
For this milestone, we revised some items in Milestone 2. In particular, we revised our persona, so that there was a better alignment of our persona's goals and the final creation of our app, and it was clear how our app features connected to our persona's needs.

Additionally, we revised our final sketches, by adding arrows so that the information flow between the UI frames was clearer. 

## 2. Planning & Psuedocode
### (1) Usability Test
Except for the final sketch we made in the milestone 3, we decided to make a prototype using Figma and conducted usability tests. We volunteered to do the usability tests because we felt it was very necessary to get feedback and revise our design in the early stage. We believed it would actually save us time since we could fix the design problems before we started coding. We chose to use Figma instead of the final sketch for the usability test because the Figma prototype would be much more similar to the final product, and therefore, the feedback received from using Figama should be more accurate than the ones received from using paper prototype.

### (2ï¼‰App Structure
![information hierarchy](images/information_hierarchy/0_Overview.png)

We drew this information hierarchy to help us plan the app structure. Our app has four main pages: browse, plan, saved, and profile. By analyzing the elements on each page, we compartmentalized the app into the layout part and component part. The layout part is to arrange the UI elements location on every single page, so the app will look like the prototype. Components are the UI elements that shared across pages or used multiple times, such as the recipe card, recipe detail page, and the bottom navigation bar. The component part is implemented, so the information will be exchanged across different app pages, and the app will be functional.

### (3) Schedule

We discussed and agreed on this in-team schedule to help us track the progress. We tried to stick to this schedule as close as possible. Most of the work has been finished in time.
