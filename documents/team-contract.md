# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

McGraw Studio 

2. To what goals do we all commit?

- Have a high quality product by the end of the semester
- Making sure we give our best efforts to contribute to the product and attend team meetings consistently 

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Have all work completed 24 hours before milestone due dates 
- Communicate at least a day in advance if you’re missing team studio time / external team meetings
- Hold team meetings as long as 3 out of 4 team members are present

- Once a week outside of class via Zoom, or in-person when necessary, at 2-3pm on Sundays.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

- External Project Coordinator: Go to TAs’ office hour if we need help with coding or design
- Internal Project Coordinator: Check the team work progress; help schedule team meetings
- Meeting scheduler: Send Zoom links for weekly meeting.

We will rotate our roles each week.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- We’ll distribute tasks equally and based on everyone’s skill sets.
- We’ll hold each other accountable by regularly updating each other on the progress that we have made with tasks, and checking in with each other during team meetings to see if anyone needs help. 
- For team members who don’t contribute equally, we will take an empathetic approach and check in with them to understand why they’re not contributing. After checking in, and they continue to fail to contribute after discussion, we will inform the instructor of the conflict.
- We’ll learn if there's an inappropriate role assigned and accommodate our roles if needed. 
- Respond to the messages in the messenger to let each other know that you have read the messages

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- Ask for TAs or Kyle’s suggestions
- Update the team contract as needed
- Provide opportunities for all team members to fully communicate their ideas


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

- We will revisit this contract if we find that a rule doesn’t work for a team, or there’s repeated conflict.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

- Wear clothes in the same color to the class if we have a big accomplishment
- Drink Boba together after completing each milestone
