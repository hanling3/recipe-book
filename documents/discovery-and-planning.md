# Discovery and Planning

# Users
Who are your users? Identify users that need assistance “finding recipes” or need a karaoke diversion.

Clearly state how many users you interviewed/studied. Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them. Lastly, provide an executive summary of key points that you learned about the users’ goals. Note, you will need to use affinity diagramming (document this process with photos) to help you identify themes in your data.
