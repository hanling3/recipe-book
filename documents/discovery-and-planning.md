Overall, we interviewed 15 users - 8 users in our first round of interviews, and 7 users in our second round of interviews. Our first round was more unstructured, in that we held brief 5 minute conversations with peers we could find around us, such as roommates, classmates, those walking around in Duffield, etc. After we looked at our insights for the first round, we narrowed down a user group and created an interview protocol so that we can pinpoint some specific insights from our target users. We have included our raw notes and summaries for each user below.

    - How much time you have to prepare
    - Customize app to their experiences

Value Propositions:
College students want to save money and time at eating, and they need healthy and delicious meals that can be prepared quickly in their apartments. They need such a product that help them cook delicious meals quickly within the budget. The current alternatives students have are recipe apps like BBC good food and Xiachufang. Users can upload their own recipes, check the chef-made recipes and tutorial videos in the app. These apps have the limit that they cannot help users to plan the time and money spent on cooking. But our product can do that. Our product can filter the recipes by the country category, budget, and time of cooking. After users insert their weekly grocery budget, the time planned on preparing meals, and the food category, the app will create a list of ingredients and the recipes for each meal of the week. Users can purchse all of these ingredients in one grocery shopping, and the product will remind them of the recipe before each meal. A customized meal plan is designed for you in just a few clicks, and this feature is only in our product.
