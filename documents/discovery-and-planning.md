# 1. Users

To develop our user group, we first brainstormed and listed possible users, characteristics, problem spaces. Many ideas included college students because they were our most accessible group for interviews, and so we decided to choose college students as our target users for the first stage. Then, in order to narrow down our project scope, we tried to make a Google survey to gather information about their experience with cooking and finding recipes. However, we received feedback from a TA that suggested we use a more efficient UX research method by conducting several brief, unstructured interviews with individuals who we could find immediately around us, in order to figure out their pain points and needs. Thus, for our first round of user research, we conducted 8 user interviews and then came together as a team to discuss the insights. This led us to the target user group we found below. We have included our summaries and raw notes for each user in the "User Interview Summaries" and "Additional Items" section.

## Target Users
Students living off campus trying to cook efficiently, save money, and eat healthy and delicious meals.

# [Revised] 2. Gather Information

After our initial round of interviews, we decided to conduct more in-depth interviews in order to gain more specific insights about the goals, beliefs, and motivations of our users. Thus, our team worked together to draft a interview protocol, which included a script to introduce and end the interview, and a set of questions, building from personal questions to questions related to grocery shopping, cooking, and recipe finding habits. We anticipated interviews might take around 30 minutes, based on the questions we deemed necessary to ask.

Interview Expected Time: 30 minutes

## User Interview Summaries

Collectively, we interviewed 15 users - 8 users in our first round of interviews, and 7 users in our second round of interviews. Our first round was unstructured, in that we held brief 5 minute conversations with peers we could find around us, such as roommates, classmates, those walking around in Duffield, etc. After we looked at our insights for the first round, we narrowed down a user group and created an interview protocol so that we can pinpoint some specific insights from our target users in the second round. We have included our raw notes and summaries for each user below.

# 3. Problems

From our insights, we discovered the following problems:

1. Students don’t have too much time for cooking
2. Students don’t want to spend money on dining out
3. Students miss home food
4. Grocery stores are far away
5. Some students are not confident at cooking
6. Sometimes students don’t remember the recipes they have used 

We identified 2 key problems to address: 
1. Students don’t have too much time and money for cooking
2. Students miss home food

We decided on these 2 key problems because we found that these were the two biggest pain points for our users. In cooking, students are primarily limited by resources, mainly time and money. Additionally, because most students at Cornell don't come from Ithaca themselves, they oftentimes found themselves recreating recipes their parents used to make them and/or they grew up eating.

- Benefit of our product is that users can filter the recipes by the country category, budget, and time needed for cooking. 


# [Revised] 5. Scenarios

## Scenario 1: (Browse -> Filter)
Robo has been studying abroad for 2 years and they miss the food in their hometown. Dining out is too expensive, so they want to cook some hometown dishes for dinner. Robo only has a $20 budget for this meal and 30 minutes to cook. They explore the various recipes in the Recipe Finder app and quickly find a fitting recipe for their needs. Robo is so happy about the recipe they find, and they cannot wait to show the finished dish to their friends. 

## Scenario 2: (Add to Meal Plan)
Robo tends to be very busy during the midterm week, and they can’t afford to spend more than 30 minutes on cooking each meal. To save them some time during the midterm week, they want to plan that week’s meal in advance. Robo starts by adding meal recipes to the calendar, and they finish planning the meals quickly. Robo is so happy that they don’t have to think about what to eat next week.

## Scenario 3: (Add Recipes & Check Created Recipes)
Robo creates a new dish and they cannot wait to share this recipe with their friends. They first upload a hand-written recipe picture, but the picture quality is not that good, so they decide to type in the recipe details. They show their friends all the recipes they created and receive lots of compliments. Roho feels so proud that they cook more and more often.

## Scenario 4: (Profile + Mark as Cooked) 
Robo is new to cooking, and their friends recommend this recipe app. Robo downloads this app, searches and follows 2 recipes for lunch and dinner on the same day. Robo marks these two recipes as cooked and saves one of them for future reference. Then they notice that they get a new badge “Cooking Journey Begins” on their profile. They are very excited about this accomplishment as a beginner and looking forward to recording her cooking journey.
