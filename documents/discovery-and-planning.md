# Discovery and Planning

# 1. Users
Who are your users? Identify users that need assistance “finding recipes” or need a karaoke diversion.


# 2. Gather Information
You should collect information from at least 6 users (graduate teams). 
Clearly state how many users you interviewed/studied. Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them. Lastly, provide an executive summary of key points that you learned about the users’ goals. Note, you will need to use affinity diagramming (document this process with photos) to help you identify themes in your data.

College students are busy and have limited budgets to dining out, and they want to have healthy and delicious meals prepared quickly in their apartments. They are motivated to use a product that can help them prepare meals quickly and efficiently under an amount of budget. The current alternatives students have are apps like BBC good food and Xiachufang. These apps allow users to upload their recipes, and chef-made recipes and tutorial videos will also be available to users. Compared to the alternatives, our product can be customized. Our users can insert their weekly grocery budget, the time they plan to spend on preparing each meal, and the food category they want to eat in the app. Then, the app will create a list of ingredients for the week and the recipes for each meal based on the restrictions. Our app helps users to save money by allowing them to purchase all they need in a week (or more) at one time, and therefore, the cost is lower and food wasting is avoided. Times for meal preparation will be much shorter, because the weekly meal plan has been auto generated, and users will not need to decide what they want and how to cook before every meal. Target users will prefer our product over the alternatives because our app is much more customizable than the alternatives.
