# Discovry and Planning

# 1. Users
Who are your users? Identify users that need assistance “finding recipes” or need a karaoke diversion.


# 2. Gather Information
You should collect information from at least 6 users (graduate teams) 
Clearly state how many users you interviewed/studied. Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them. Lastly, provide an executive summary of key points that you learned about the users’ goals. Note, you will need to use affinity diagramming (document this process with photos) to help you identify themes in your data.


# 3. Problems
 identify 1 or 2 key problems that your team wants to address. 


# 4. Value Propositions
You should define the value propositions of your product. These value propositions should address the key problems you identified. You need to identify why your users will want to use your product. See your text for examples.


# 5. Scenarios
Produce a scenario for each key problem/value proposition. Note you will likely need more than one scenario.


# 6. Persona


# 7. Project Themes
