## User Interview Summaries

Overall, we interviewed 15 users - 8 users in our first round of interviews, and 7 users in our second round of interviews. Our first round was more unstructured, in that we held brief 5 minute conversations with peers we could find around us, such as roommates, classmates, those walking around in Duffield, etc. After we looked at our insights for the first round, we narrowed down a user group and created an interview protocol so that we can pinpoint some specific insights from our target users. We have included our raw notes and summaries for each user below.

Round 1: Unstructured

Round 2: Semi-structured
- User 1: 
- User 2: The user was a female graduate student currently living in Collegetown. We learned that she prioritizes convenience and frequently uses meal delivery services such as HelloFresh and SunBasket. She is not confident in her cooking skills and is trying to best to teach herself. She cooks in order to eat healthier and to save money.

- User 3: The user was a male graduate student currently living in Collegetown Terrace. He has several dietary restrictions, including nuts and various fruits. We learned that he is relatively confident in his cooking skills, and cooks on a daily basis, doesn't really have a budget when cooking, and oftentimes finds himself looking up recipes for dishes his mom used to prepare for him, in order to double check details such as sauce ratios. He cooks because he enjoys having control over his diet. 

- User 4: The user was a female graduate student currently living in North side of campus. We learned that she is very confident at his cooking and she cooks everyday. She does not have a budget for grocery. She eats 2 meals a day, and it usually takes her 5 minuts to decide the recipe and 30-40 minutes to prepare a meal. Most of the time she creates her own recipes, and sometimes she will search recipes on YouTube or Xiaohongshu. She cooks because she wants to eat Asian food and cooking is much cheaper than dining out.

- User 5: The user was a female graduate student currently libing in Collegetown Terrace. We learned that she started cooking since middle school, and she cooks almost everyday. She is very condifent about cooking. It takes her 20-30 minuts to prepare a meal, and she searches recipes on Xiachufang. She does not have a budget on grocery and dining out. She likes to cook because she can decide what to eat.

# 3. Problems

Based on insights we found in the affinity diagram, we summarized the problems below:
1. Students don’t have too much time for cooking
2. Students don’t want to spend money on dining out
3. Students miss home food
4. Grocery stores are far away
5. Some students are not confident at cooking
6. Sometimes students don’t remember the recipes they have used 

We identify 2 key problems that our team wants to address: 
1. Students don’t have too much time and money for cooking
2. Students miss home food


# 4. Value Propositions

Possible ideas: 
    - Insert budget
    - How much time you have to prepare
    - Customize app to their experiences
    - filters/categories for recipes - e.g. chinese, american, etc
    - Plan meals - don't have to think about dinner / lunch - better control time + budget

Value Propositions:
College students want to save money and time at eating, and they need healthy and delicious meals that can be prepared quickly in their apartments. They need such a product that help them cook delicious meals quickly within the budget. The current alternatives students have are recipe apps like BBC good food and Xiachufang. Users can upload their own recipes, check the chef-made recipes and tutorial videos in the app. These apps have the limit that they cannot help users to plan the time and money spent on cooking. But our product can do that. Our product can filter the recipes by the country category, budget, and time of cooking. After users insert their weekly grocery budget, the time planned on preparing meals, and the food category, the app will create a list of ingredients and the recipes for each meal of the week. Users can purchse all of these ingredients in one grocery shopping, and the product will remind them of the recipe before each meal. A customized meal plan is designed for you in just a few clicks, and this feature is only in our product.


# 5. Scenarios
Produce a scenario for each key problem/value proposition. Note you will likely need more than one scenario.

Scenario 1
You are very busy during the midterm week so you want to spend less than 30mins to cook for each meal and save enough time for studying. Navigating in the recipe app and looking for a recipe of 30 mins quick dishes to cook.

Scenario 2
You’ve studied abroad for 2 years and missed the food in your hometown, but ordering Asian food delivery is too expensive for you. Therefore, you want to cook some hometown dishes within a $20 budget for dinner. Try to navigate yourself to recipes of your hometown dishes in the app and choose one recipe within your budget to cook.


# 7. Project Themes

Our Recipe Finder project themes include the following:
- Mobile-responsive. Develop an app that is responsive both on desktop and mobile. 
- Budget-friendly. Take advantage of filters and enable users to plan meals according to a filter based on budget. 
- Time-awareness. Rethink meal planning and allow users to further adjust their meal planning by allowing users to select meals based on time. 
- Performance. Make it easy for users to navigate and find recipes that remind them of home.
