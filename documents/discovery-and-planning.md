## User Interview Summaries

Overall, we interviewed 15 users - 8 users in our first round of interviews, and 7 users in our second round of interviews. Our first round was more unstructured, in that we held brief 5 minute conversations with peers we could find around us, such as roommates, classmates, those walking around in Duffield, etc. After we looked at our insights for the first round, we narrowed down a user group and created an interview protocol so that we can pinpoint some specific insights from our target users.

She is not confident in her cooking skills and is trying to best to teach herself. She cooks in order to eat healthier and to save money.

- User 3: The user was a male graduate student currently living in Collegetown Terrace. He has several dietary restrictions, including nuts and various fruits. We learned that he is relatively confident in his cooking skills, and cooks on a daily basis, doesn't really have a budget when cooking, and oftentimes finds himself looking up recipes for dishes his mom used to prepare for him, in order to double check details such as sauce ratios. He cooks because he enjoys having control over his diet. 

- User 4: The user was a female graduate student currently living in North side of campus. We learned that she is very confident at his cooking and she cooks everyday. She does not have a budget for grocery. She eats 2 meals a day, and it usually takes her 5 minuts to decide the recipe and 30-40 minutes to prepare a meal. Most of the time she creates her own recipes, and sometimes she will search recipes on YouTube or Xiaohongshu. She cooks because she wants to eat Asian food and cooking is much cheaper than dining out.

She is very condifent about cooking. It takes her 20-30 minuts to prepare a meal, and she searches recipes on Xiachufang. She does not have a budget on grocery and dining out.

# 4. Value Propositions

Brainstorming: 
    Should contain: 
    - Target users + their motivation(s) for using a product / feature
    - The alternatives
    - Benefits of the product / feature (compared to the alternatives)
    - Costs (e.g. money, time, etc) (compared to alternatives)

    Possible ideas: 
    - Insert budget
    - How much time you have to prepare
    - Customize app to their experiences
    - filters/categories for recipes - e.g. chinese, american, etc
    - Plan meals - don't have to think about dinner / lunch - better control time + budget

Value Propositions:
College students want to save money and time at eating, and they need healthy and delicious meals that can be prepared quickly in their apartments. They need such a product that help them cook delicious meals quickly within the budget. The current alternatives students have are recipe apps like BBC good food and Xiachufang. Users can upload their own recipes, check the chef-made recipes and tutorial videos in the app. These apps have the limit that they cannot help users to plan the time and money spent on cooking. But our product can do that. Our product can filter the recipes by the country category, budget, and time of cooking. After users insert their weekly grocery budget, the time planned on preparing meals, and the food category, the app will create a list of ingredients and the recipes for each meal of the week. Users can purchse all of these ingredients in one grocery shopping, and the product will remind them of the recipe before each meal. A customized meal plan is designed for you in just a few clicks, and this feature is only in our product.
