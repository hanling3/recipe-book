# Discovery and Planning

# 1. Users
We first brainstormed and listed our possible users. However, we thought college students are a group of people we may have more chance to reach out to so we choose students as our target user at first stage. Then we tried to make a survey to gather information about their cooking and finding recipes experience but the TA suggested us a more efficient ux research method by  conducting several short semi-interviews with people to figure out their pain points and needs. We conducted 8 user interviews and discussed the insights which led us to our target users below. We have included our summaries and raw notes for each user in the "User Interview Summaries" and "Additional items" section.

## User Interview Summaries

Overall, we interviewed 15 users - 8 users in our first round of interviews, and 7 users in our second round of interviews. Our first round was more unstructured, in that we held brief 5 minute conversations with peers we could find around us, such as roommates, classmates, those walking around in Duffield, etc. After we looked at our insights for the first round, we narrowed down a user group and created an interview protocol so that we can pinpoint some specific insights from our target users. We have included our raw notes and summaries for each user below.

# 3. Problems

Based on the insights we found in the affinity diagram, we discovered the following problems:

1. Students don’t have too much time for cooking
2. Students don’t want to spend money on dining out
3. Students miss home food
4. Grocery stores are far away
5. Some students are not confident at cooking
6. Sometimes students don’t remember the recipes they have used 

We identify 2 key problems that our team wants to address: 
1. Students don’t have too much time and money for cooking
2. Students miss home food

We decided on these 2 key problems because we found that these were the two biggest pain points for our users. In cooking, students are primarily limited by resources, mainly time and money. Additionally, because most students at Cornell don't come from Ithaca themselves, they oftentimes found themselves recreating recipes their parents used to make them and/or they grew up eating.


# 4. Value Propositions

College students want to save money and time at eating, and they need healthy and delicious meals that can be prepared quickly in their apartments. They need a product that helps them find recipes to cook delicious meals quickly within the budget. Students currently use recipe websites such as BBC Good Food and Xiachufang. Users can upload their own recipes and peruse chef-made recipes and tutorial videos within these apps. These apps however cannot help users meal plan, in terms of time and money (for ingredients). But our product can do that. Our product can filter the recipes by the country category, budget, and time needed for cooking. After users insert their weekly grocery budget, how much time they have for preparing meals, and their chosen food category, the app will generate a list of ingredients and recipes for each meal of the week. Users can then plan to purchase all of these ingredients in one grocery shopping trip, and the product will remind them of the recipe before each meal. A customized meal plan is designed for you in just a few clicks, a feature availble only in our product.

# 5. Scenarios

We plan to use the following 2 scenarios to evaluate our app: 

## Scenario 1
You are very busy during the midterm week, so you want to spend less than 30 minutes to cook each meal and save enough time for studying. Navigate the recipe app and see if you can find recipes for 30 minute quick dishes.

## Scenario 2
You’ve studied abroad for 2 years and missed the food in your hometown, but ordering Asian food delivery is too expensive for you. Therefore, you want to cook some hometown dishes within a $20 budget for dinner. Try to navigate yourself to recipes of your hometown dishes in the app and find one recipe within your budget to cook.
