# Debrief Notes
- User 1: John
    - In task 1&2, the user was not sure if the recipe was added to the meal plan/favorite list successfully, there is no notification pop-up
        - (Need to give users feedback after they click the add button)
    - In task 3, it took the user a long time to find the upload tab. Found the upload button when he checked the upload tab for the second time.
        - User suggested to put the add icon on the center of the page
- User 2: Peter
    - In task 1, the user found the miso ramen recipe without clicking the filter button
        - (We need to add more mock data)
    - In task 1 & 2, the user was uncertain whether the recipe was added to the meal plan successfully. User checked the meal plan page to confirm
        - (Need to add a notification/feedback for users)
- User 3: Qi
    - In task 1, the user thought for a while whether the recipe had been added to the meal plan or not but still tried to have a look at the meal plan page.
        - (Need to give users feedback after they click the add button)
    - In task 3, it took the user a long time to find the upload tab but finally found it hidden behind the navigation bar.
        - User suggested putting the add button in an obvious place like the center of the page. 

- User 4: Jason
    - Task 1
        - confused that plan page didnt show anything at first when trying to complete this taste
        - didnt really read instructions on browse page
        - Confused as to whether the “add to meal plan” successfully happened
    - Task 2 
        - Intuitive; would be nice to have system feedback for “add to favorite” button being clicked 
    - Task 3 
        - Although he found the button, really difficult to see the “add recipe” button - need to bring it up higher on the page 
        - Found inputting ingredients field by field a bit tedious - consider clumping together
        - Reducing number of input fields on this page overall 
    - Overall
        - Intuitive to find things
        - Confused by plan function not working
        - Profile page:
        - Didnt like that the badges all looked the same
        - Search bar would be helpful for searching up specific recipes, such as 
        the kung pao chicken recipe from before; especially if database has thousands of recipes
        - Confused as to purpose of badge system
        - Would like to be able to save recipes from places such as youtube in saved recipes list
        - Would like a dark mode to get flash banged 
- User 5: Jun
    - Task 1
        - Says filtered/unfiltered button is not intuitive; would be better to have an auto filter/search function 
    - Task 2
        - Perhaps add an alert for the user to check the “favorites” page to let them know a recipe has been added 
    - Task 3 
        - had trouble finding “+” button - need to make more visible
    - Overall
        - Thinks itd be helpful if the plan function reset each week
        - Would be nice to sort by ingredients / main ingredients because people sort by what they have in the fridge 
        - Would be nice to be able to categorize favorites - level of “favoritism,” dishes; doesnt want to browse entire thing
        - Could be good to have a “replacement ingredients” list feature
        - Most important thing to him is a large recipe database + search function
        - Not sure how he feels about profile
            - Whole badges are nice but doesnt think it adds anything substantial
            - Does like the cooking report
            - Would be interesting to include: 
            - List of things he has bought previously
            - Difference in expected costs of recipes & actual costs
            - Tracking frequency + macronutrients
