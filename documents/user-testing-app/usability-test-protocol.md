# Userability Test Protocol

# Revisions

- User testing platform changed from figma prototype to our app website.
- Changed scenario 1: plan for next Monday to plan for Nov.29th.

## Welcome + Introduction Script 
Hi [user's name]. I'm [your name(s)] from the McGraw Studio. Today we are going to test the prototype of our Recipe Finder app to better understand the performance of our mobile app, which focuses on allowing users to meal plan. 

During the user test, please speak your thoughts out loud as you go through the tasks. 
This will help us understand why you are making certain choices. Also, please do not worry if you make mistakes while conducting tasks; if you have trouble completing a task, it is the fault of the design, not you. The study will take about 25 minutes. If you have any questions during the testing, please feel free to ask them now. 

## Informed Consent 
We'll need you to consent for the video recording. Is that okay with you? Information gathered today will only be used for study purposes, and will be kept secure. 

Do you have any questions? If not, let's get started!

If permission is given by the user, the notetaker will begin Zoom screen recording. 

Notetaker will use this template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Si9a80d9krN3ZMmfWeP3cqn-0jKALopQWumauMazuu4/edit?usp=sharing

## Background Questions
First, to gain some context about yourself: 
- Could you tell us your name, major, and year?
- Do you have experience of using recipe apps? If so, what is the frequency?
- Do you have a habit of making a weekly meal plan? Why or why not?
    - [If they do make a weekly meal plan] Can you describe to us what your meal planning process looks like? 


## Prototype Interaction Instructions 
Okay, we will now take a look at our prototype. Facilitator will open the app website home page. 

Notetaker will time each task after the facilitator has read the directions, and will count the number of errors made in their notes. 

During the testing, we encourage you to talk about your thoughts. 

- What are your initial impressions of our app? 

Okay, we will now begin the usability test.

## Test
For each task, the facilitator will read aloud the task, and then watch as the user completes the task. The facilitator should avoid giving hints / clarifications to the user, so as the app design team we can understand which parts of the user flow of the app are confusing.

The notetaker will observe whether the user takes the “happy path” and watch as any errors are made.  

### Task 1: Plan
You’re very busy during the midterm week, so you want to save enough time for studying. You figure the best way to do this is by meal planning for the week ahead. Choose a recipe for dinner time (Nov.29th) that takes less than 30 minutes, is under $10, is Japanese cuisine, and is easy to cook. 

### Task 2: Favorites (part 1)
As you’re scheduling recipes from your meal plan, you find a Kung Pao chicken recipe that you really like and want to save it for later. Save this recipe to your favorites list. 

### Task 3: Favorites (part 2)
You’ve been calling your mom about recipes from home. You want to quickly save a recipe she mentioned somewhere for future reference. Upload the recipe she’s called you about and view it in your favorites list to make sure it is saved. 

[Facilitator will copy and paste the text below into the Zoom chat.] 
- The name of the dish is: tomato and egg stir fry
- Total preparation time: 10 minutes
- The ingredients list includes: 4 tomatoes, 4 eggs, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon sugar  
- Instructions are:
    - Cut tomatoes into quarters.
    - Crack all eggs into a bowl and mix with sesame oil and soy sauce. 
    - Preheat the wok over medium heat. Add eggs and scramble. Then take out and set aside. 
    - Next, add in your tomatoes and sugar. Stir fry for 2 minutes. 
    - Add eggs back into the wok and stir fry together. 
    - Transfer into a serving dish and serve. 
- Your mom’s tips: Adjust sugar and soy sauce as needed. 

### Task 4: Profile (persuasive design element)
You’ve been using the recipe finder for a while, and you recently received a badge for cooking 20 recipes from the recipe app. View this badge in your achievement history. 

## Additional Questions
What are your impressions of the app after using it?
How do you think this app would fit into your daily life? 
Do you have any additional thoughts you would like to share? 

## Evaluation
Usability evaluation + thank you script 
Lastly, thank you for participating in this user testing session. 



Please evaluate your experience of using the app and give us the ratings of usability and desirebility based on criteria below.

- Functionality: Users must be able to utilize applications to make their meal plans and explore various recipes efficiently.

- Desirability: Software must be intriguing and friendly so that users get a feeling to reuse and come back. Needs to facilitate the user so they can gain comfortable riding experience so that they can explore events without transportation-related concerns.

- Usability: The application interface should be very legible and easy to navigate so that users across multiple demographics can use it. Graphics for buttons should be clear on  what they are meant for. Ideally accessible from the moment software is opened up until the user chooses to close it based on will not frustration.
