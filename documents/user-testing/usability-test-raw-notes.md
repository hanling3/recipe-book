## Additional Questions / End of Study Notes

- app keeps things very direct - dont have to click and click and click to find things
- she can imagine where to find things and pull it right out 
- she’ve noticed other people using meal plan apps and they have to click forever to find what they want to do 
- she thinks its bc of the prototype some of the clicks are not valid, e.g. cant see the favorites section
- also when shes adding the recipe, such as adding the recipe from her mom, will have to type instead of magically appearing

- question about the recipe
- what are the groups of people expected to use this app -chinese / asian audience, or open to everyone?
- will it include african americans, asian
- we’re focused on college students, not a specific area
- helping college students to save recipe 
- bc during the test all the recipes, such as miso ramen, kung pao chicken, etc - its all asian, so user was wondering if in the future if they’re adding more recipes what kind of cuisine they’ll include
- would the cuisine be more asian-heavy, or be a balance of everything 
- we built it based on interviews

- since joyce is not a planing person
- could be challenging [to fit into her life] in the beginning
- in the tasks, she’ll prob plan everything ahead - everything a week ahead, a few days ahead
- might change grocery style - instead of changing grocery style, might change the recipe style so she has a more targeted approach in the grocery store 

- any additional thoughts?

- how do you guys estimate budget for each recipe? 
- ~ubereats - if a recipe looks cheap, then we’ll give it a low dollar sign
- Joyce tends to go grocery shopping in person at the shop
- she noticed, green star vs wegman’s vs walmart - definitely a price difference. Green star is more expensive than wegman’s, and wegman’s more expensive than walmart - so curious if in the future if we’ll actually go to common grocery stores and estimate price based on grocery store experiences, or rely on uber eats or other existing applications to estimate price

- we will likely estimate 

- other feedback - def adding photos to the recipe finder for sure
- for the badges - is this just something that gives the user an encouragement to have them keep using it? Why did we want to include badges?

- motivator/encourager to encourage users to use app more frequently 
- some apps have exclusive recipes, where you have to pay

- not about thinking about making profits from this app?
Bc most app creators are trying to make money from the app store
- currently we plan to make it free 

(Hedy’s question) when she was trying to add a new recipe - add button
- she initially clicked the first button - the camera button
- saw something a the top so she just goes for it
- when we’re uploading a recipe, we’re also uploading a picture of the completed product / dish when it’s finished - e.g. when you’re designing an app you’re matching an image to the recipe 
- 50/50 chance of being right


## Debrief
Perhaps not include 2 icons after + icon into recipe in the favorites section

## Additional Questions / End of Study Notes
- Initial impression
    - An app to plan meals for all day
- Impression after using the app
    - The “+” icon in the “Favorite” page is on the top right corner, very hard to see
    - Assuming the “Favorite” is for the recipes that have been added, not for adding new recipes (Task 2)
    - People are more likely to search recipes, instead of adding recipes 
    - Don’t understand the badge system (Task 4)
    - Would not be a motivation for him to use the app
    - The awarding can be changed a little bit
    - The user flow is not that clear; navigation bar can be improved
    - This app is somewhere helpful 
    - People’s favorites change over time, and they may not save all of their favorite recipes in this app, - making the “Favorite” tab less helpful
    - The interview protocol is very helpful for users to go over each tasks

## Additional Questions / End of Study Notes
- Thinks design is good, very simple to use
- From her own perspective - would want more color to it
- Right now its black/white, so it’s not fun for her
- She was struggling with adding a recipe
- Usually she looks at the main body
- The + sign in the top right corner for adding recipes was easy to not see at first (perhaps due to contrast)
- Sugegsts we could also add more categories in the menu bar
- “Add your own recipes” in your recipe bar
- But can even create her own menu, instead of finding “+” button in the favorites page
- Flow of adding recipes is pretty good
- She liked the filtering option


- This functionality is interesting
- Thinks someone would want it; good for writing recipes + finding online recipes
- However, for kung pao chicken recipe for instance -
- For ppl to want to use it more frequently is perhaps how healthy the recipe is - such as calories


- No additional thoughts

## Additional Questions / End of Study Notes
Impression of the app: She thinks the app is similar to other apps. It looks clear and clean. It lacks of communication with users: when the users clicked the wrong button, which leads them to a wrong function, the app doesn’t tell them what to do next. She wanted to click favorites list but failed. She thinks the badge design is not good because users would not click on the badges when they were not instructed. She thinks the contents appeared after users click the badges should be changed to a hover. She wouldn’t think of clicking “Favorites” for uploading the recipe. She thinks “add a recipe” in the meal plan page misleads her to the task “uploading the recipe”. (wordy problems)

Fit into daily life: She thinks the app could have provided a questionnaire to users for users’ preference. She thinks students who are busy completing their course works won’t use the meal plan function because they would rather search the recipes when they need.
