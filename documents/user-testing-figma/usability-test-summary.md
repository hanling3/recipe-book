# Usability Test Summary

## Feedback Summary
* User 1: Joyce
    * Task 3: The user assumed that the camera button is for uploading pictures of the dish, the pencil is for inputting ingredients. 
    * Task 4: The user hesitated before clicking a badge for detail.
    * Suggestion
        * Add meal -> add breakfast / brunch/ lunch/dinner / late night snacks. Bc people have different plans about their meals. This user only eats brunch and dinner.
        * Pricing varies in different states and cities, suggest us to do some research about the price variance in different state to improve the budget accurate

* User 2: Lucy
    * Task 3: Was struggling with adding recipes, seldom would look at the top, hard to see the add button at the top at first 
    * Can add more thing in the bottom menu bar, such as a personal menu bar so can add recipes directly from the bottom of the bar

* User 3: Katie
    * Task 2: After using it, felt kinda confused
        * Assumed to search the recipes from the “Favorite” tab 
        * Took a relatively long time to realize it was in the “Plan” tab and “Add your recipe” button

* User 4: Tim
    * Task 2: The “+” icon in the “Favorite” page is on the top right corner, very hard to see
        * Assuming the “Favorite” is for the recipes that have been added, not for adding new recipes 
        * People are more likely to search recipes, instead of adding recipes 
    * Task 4: Don’t understand the badge system
        * Would not be a motivation for him to use the app
        * The awarding can be changed a little bit
    * The user flow is not that clear; navigation bar can be improved

* User 5: Kelly
    * Task 3: Super confusing. Tried everything she could


## Revisions to Prototype 
* Plan page
    * (Reach goal) Adding search functionality to the plan page
    * Replace “+ Find your recipe” to search  icon + “find a recipe” 
    * Add a pop-up page after clicking the “Add recipes”, then users can choose whether they want to type in a quick note for that meal, or search actual recipes and add them to the meal plan
* Favorites page
    * Change the layout of the add recipe button in the favorites - move the add button (“+ Upload”) to navigation bar, and remove the pencil & camera buttons as well 
    * Change the text of “Favorite” in the navigation bar to “Saved”
    * For favorites page - 
        * For the favorites tab, when it’s empty: Add a message on the center of the page “No created recipes yet. Upload your own recipes using the “+” button below.”
        * For the created recipes tab, when it’s empty:  Add a message on the center of the page “No favorited recipes yet. Explore the recipes our app has to offer through the plan page!” 
* Profile page
    * Making it more obvious that the badges can be clicked in the profile page - adding perhaps lines 
* (If we have more time)
    * Add different kinds of recipes? (calories information, diet meal plan, allergy sources)
