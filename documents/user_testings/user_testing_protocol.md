Hi [user's name]. I'm [your name(s)] from the McGraw Studio group. Today we are going to test the prototype of our Recipe Finder app. During the user testing, please speak all your thoughts aloud as you go through the tasks. This will help us understand why you are making certain choices. The study will take about 10 minutes. If you have any questions during the testing, we will answer them at the end of the study.

We'll need you to consent for video recording. Is that okay with you? Information gathered today will only be used for study purposes, and will be kept secure. 

Do you have any questions?

Let's get started!
