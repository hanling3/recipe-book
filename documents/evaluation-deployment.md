## Findings and Insights
1. Problem1: 5/5 users had hard time to find "upload recipe" button. While we were conducting user testing, almost all of our participants mentioned they would like to see this button in an evident place that can attract their attention. Solution/Plan for next steps: firstly, we will add text to the current icon button to help users better understand action by reducing their cognitive workload. Then, we will change location of the button to center of the page to get user's attention more efficienty. 

2. Problem2: No clear feedbacks on actions. 5/5 users mentioned that they were not sure if the recipe was added to the meal plan/favorite list successfully and we observed that users would switch to certain pages to confirm recipes were successfully added. Solution/Plan for next steps: Provide confirmation message in the form of pop-up window to inform users that actions have been executed successfully.

3. Problem3: Users prefer to browse the recipes first and add it to meal plan. Solution/Plan for next steps: We will change the user flow of adding recipe to meal plan by making user add recipes to meal plan in recipe detailed page and then schedule the recipe a specific date on meal plan page.

4. Problem4: Badges with same icon made users confused. As the user said "all the badges look the same and make me confused". Solution/Plan for next steps: We will replace star icon with other icons that are more related to different implications of badges, which we believe that would have a better communication with users about what each badges represents.
