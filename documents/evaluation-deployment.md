# Revision
## Findings and Insights
1. Problem1: 5/5 users had hard time to find "upload recipe" button. While we were conducting user testing, almost all of our participants mentioned they would like to see this button in an evident place that can attract their attention. Solution/Plan for next steps: firstly, we will add text to the current icon button to help users better understand action by reducing their cognitive workload. Then, we will change location of the button to middle of the page to get user's attention more efficienty. 

2. Problem2: No clear feedbacks on actions. 5/5 users mentioned that they are not sure Solution/Plan for next steps:
3. Problem2: Users prefer browse the recipes first and add it to meal plan. 
4. Problem4: Badges with same icon made users confused.
